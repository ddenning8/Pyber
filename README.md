Our objective was to build a bubble plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:
- Average Fare ($) Per City
- Total Number of Rides Per City
- Total Number of Drivers Per City
- City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, we produced the following pie charts using Matplotlib:
- % of Total Fares by City Type
- % of Total Rides by City Type
- % of Total Drivers by City Type
